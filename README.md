# Reduce_Points
A shelf script for Harmony. It reduces point counts of vector graphics using pre-existing MLT licensed library (https://github.com/soswow/fit-curves). This script is meant to create a tool alternative to Harmony's native Smooth Tool and Smooth Command that lacks precision and also the ability to be able to process multiple items at once.
